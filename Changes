    - Just fork instead of fork & exec, memory use should be fine. I fail

    - Running Hailo was broken in 0.05 in cases where Hailo_args
      contained a value that was a hash, e.g. C<Hailo_args => {
      storage_args => { ... } }>.

    - Run Hailo code as an external command instead of forking. This way our
      memory usage is constant, rather than scaling with the size of the
      parent application.

    - Pod fix: remove duplicate METHODS section

    - Don't call DESTROY manually, it's unnecessary

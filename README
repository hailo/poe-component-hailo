SYNOPSIS

     use POE::Component::Hailo;

     POE::Session->create(
         package_states => [

                 storage_class  => 'SQLite',
                 brain_resource => 'hailo.sqlite',
             },

         $poe_kernel->post(hailo => learn => ['This is a sentence']);
     }

     sub hailo_learned {
         $poe_kernel->post(hailo => reply => ['This']);
     }

     sub hailo_replied {
         my $reply = $_[ARG0]->[0];

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Hailo is a POE component that provides a non-blocking
    wrapper around Hailo. It accepts the events listed under "INPUT" and
    emits the events listed under "OUTPUT".

METHODS
  "spawn"
    This is the constructor. It takes the following arguments:

    'alias', an optional alias for the component's session.

    'Hailo_args', a hash reference of arguments to pass to Hailo's
    constructor.

METHODS
  "session_id"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the POE Session ID of the component.

INPUT
    The POE events this component will accept.

  "learn"
  "train"
  "reply"
  "learn_reply"
    All these events take two arguments. The first is an array reference of
    arguments which will be passed to the Hailo method of the same name. The
    second (optional) is a hash reference You'll get this hash reference
    back with corresponding event listen under "OUTPUT".

  "shutdown"
    Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

OUTPUT
    The component will post these events to your session.

  "hailo_learned"
  "hailo_trained"
  "hailo_replied"
  "hailo_learn_replied"
    ARG0 is an array reference of arguments returned by the underlying Hailo
    method. ARG1 is the context hashref you provided (if any).

NAME
    POE::Component::Hailo - A non-blocking wrapper around Hailo

SYNOPSIS
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use POE qw(Component::Hailo);

     POE::Session->create(
         package_states => [
             (__PACKAGE__) => [ qw(_start hailo_learned hailo_replied) ],
         ],
     );

     POE::Kernel->run;

     sub _start {
         POE::Component::Hailo->spawn(
             alias      => 'hailo',
             Hailo_args => {
                 storage_class  => 'SQLite',
                 brain_resource => 'hailo.sqlite',
             },
         );

         POE::Kernel->post(hailo => learn =>
             ['This is a sentence'],
         );
     }

     sub hailo_learned {
         POE::Kernel->post(hailo => reply => ['This']);
     }

     sub hailo_replied {
         my $reply = $_[ARG0]->[0];
         die "Didn't get a reply" if !defined $reply;
         print "Got reply: $reply\n";
         POE::Kernel->post(hailo => 'shutdown');
     }

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Hailo is a POE component that provides a non-blocking
    wrapper around Hailo. It accepts the events listed under "INPUT" and
    emits the events listed under "OUTPUT".

METHODS
  "spawn"
    This is the constructor. It takes the following arguments:

    'alias', an optional alias for the component's session.

    'debug', set to a true value if you want debug output to be printed.
    Defaults to false.

    'Hailo_args', a hash reference of arguments to pass to Hailo's
    constructor.

METHODS
  "session_id"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the POE Session ID of the component.

INPUT
    This component reacts to the following POE events:

  "stats"
  "learn"
  "train"
  "reply"
  "learn_reply"
    All these events take two arguments. The first is an array reference of
    arguments which will be passed to the Hailo method of the same name. The
    second (optional) is a hash reference. You'll get this hash reference
    back with the corresponding event listed under "OUTPUT".

  "shutdown"
    Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

OUTPUT
    The component will post the following event to your session:

  "hailo_stats"
  "hailo_learned"
  "hailo_trained"
  "hailo_replied"
  "hailo_learn_replied"
    "ARG0" is an array reference of arguments returned by the underlying
    Hailo method. "ARG1" is the context hashref you provided (if any).

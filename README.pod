POE::Component::Hailo - A non-blocking wrapper around L<Hailo|Hailo>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use POE qw(Component::Hailo);

 POE::Session->create(
     package_states => [
         (__PACKAGE__) => [ qw(_start hailo_learned hailo_replied) ],
     ],
 );

 POE::Kernel->run;

 sub _start {
     POE::Component::Hailo->spawn(
         alias      => 'hailo',
         Hailo_args => {
             storage_class  => 'SQLite',
             brain_resource => 'hailo.sqlite',
         },
     );

     POE::Kernel->post(hailo => learn =>
         ['This is a sentence'],
     );
 }

 sub hailo_learned {
     POE::Kernel->post(hailo => reply => ['This']);
 }

 sub hailo_replied {
     my $reply = $_[ARG0]->[0];

     print "Got reply: $reply\n";
     POE::Kernel->post(hailo => 'shutdown');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::Hailo is a L<POE|POE> component that provides a
non-blocking wrapper around L<Hailo|Hailo>. It accepts the events listed
under L</INPUT> and emits the events listed under L</OUTPUT>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<spawn>

This is the constructor. It takes the following arguments:

B<'alias'>, an optional alias for the component's session.

B<'Hailo_args'>, a hash reference of arguments to pass to L<Hailo|Hailo>'s
constructor.

B<'options'>, a hash reference of options to pass to
L<POE::Session|POE::Session>'s constructor.

=head2 C<session_id>

Takes no arguments. Returns the POE Session ID of the component.

=head1 INPUT

This component reacts to the following POE events:

=head2 C<learn>

=head2 C<train>

=head2 C<reply>

=head2 C<learn_reply>

=head2 C<stats>

=head2 C<save>

All these events take two arguments. The first is an array reference of
arguments which will be passed to the L<Hailo|Hailo> method of the same
name. The second (optional) is a hash reference. You'll get this hash
reference back with the corresponding event listed under L</OUTPUT>.

=head2 C<shutdown>

Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

=head1 OUTPUT

The component will post the following event to your session:

=head2 C<hailo_learned>

=head2 C<hailo_trained>

=head2 C<hailo_replied>

=head2 C<hailo_learn_replied>

=head2 C<hailo_stats>

=head2 C<hailo_saved>

C<ARG0> is an array reference of arguments returned by the underlying
L<Hailo|Hailo> method. C<ARG1> is the context hashref you provided (if any).
